         <td>The semicolons (;) immediately following the if statement and the for loop act as terminators for those statements, causing them to execute without any associated block. Consequently, the code inside the curly braces is treated as a separate, unrelated block of code, which is why it executes unconditionally.</td>

When you then call sc.nextLine(), it reads the remaining newline character from the previous input, which appears as if it's not allowing you to enter a new string.Obviously this problem will not affect other data type inputs except string and char</td>
